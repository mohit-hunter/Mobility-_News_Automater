# Data (Optional - usually we don't commit large datasets or heavy binary files if not needed)
# However, for this project, the user might want the CSVs/JSONs to persist if they are small.
# The master_news_archive.json is 500KB, which is fine.
# The embeddings are ~1MB, which is fine.
# news.csv is 400KB. 
# So we won't ignore data files for now unless they get huge.
